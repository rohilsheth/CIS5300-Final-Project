# Strong Baseline
Our strong baseline trains a Doc2Vec model on our training dataset. This enables our model to be able to infer a vector for any document. To classify a song as sexist or not, our strong baseline infers a vector for the song and then obtains 2 cosine similarity scores: one for a vector associated with female attributes and another for a vector associated with male attributes. It classifies a song as sexist if the absolute difference between the 2 cosine similarity scores is greater than 0.05.

# Sample output
The strong baseline returns the predicted labels for the test dataset. 1 = sexist, 0 = not sexist.

# Running instructions
You need to download all of the data located at this link in order to run this code: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wuOpbEGfvpbHeFagveNmtxZJl2abTsw_/view?usp=share_link.

This code requires that gensim be installed. If gensim is not installed locally, you can use the virtual environment that was used in CIS 5300 Homework 2, which can be created by running:

```
conda create -n cis5302 python=3.8
conda activate cis5302
```

Then run `python3 strong_baseline.py` to run this code.
